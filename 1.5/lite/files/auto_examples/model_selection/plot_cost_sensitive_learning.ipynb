        "\n# Post-tuning the decision threshold for cost-sensitive learning\n\nOnce a classifier is trained, the output of the :term:`predict` method outputs class\nlabel predictions corresponding to a thresholding of either the\n:term:`decision_function` or the :term:`predict_proba` output. For a binary classifier,\nthe default threshold is defined as a posterior probability estimate of 0.5 or a\ndecision score of 0.0.\n\nHowever, this default strategy is most likely not optimal for the task at hand.\nHere, we use the \"Statlog\" German credit dataset [1]_ to illustrate a use case.\nIn this dataset, the task is to predict whether a person has a \"good\" or \"bad\" credit.\nIn addition, a cost-matrix is provided that specifies the cost of\nmisclassification. Specifically, misclassifying a \"bad\" credit as \"good\" is five\ntimes more costly on average than misclassifying a \"good\" credit as \"bad\".\n\nWe use the :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.TunedThresholdClassifierCV` to select the\ncut-off point of the decision function that minimizes the provided business\ncost.\n\nIn the second part of the example, we further extend this approach by\nconsidering the problem of fraud detection in credit card transactions: in this\ncase, the business metric depends on the amount of each individual transaction.\n\n.. rubric :: References\n\n..
