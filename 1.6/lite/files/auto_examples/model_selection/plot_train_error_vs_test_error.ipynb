This curve shows the training and test scores of the model for different\nvalues of the regularization parameter.\n\nThe regularization `alpha` is a parameter applied to the coefficients of the model:\nwhen it tends to zero, no regularization is applied and the model tries to fit the\ntraining data with the least amount of error. However, it leads to overfitting when\nfeatures are noisy. When `alpha` increases, the model coefficients are constrained,\nand thus the model cannot fit the training data as closely, avoiding overfitting.\nHowever, if too much regularization is applied, the model underfits the data and\nis not able to properly capture the signal.\n\nThe validation curve helps in finding a good trade-off between both extremes: the\nmodel is not regularized and thus flexible enough to fit the signal, but not too\nflexible to overfit.
